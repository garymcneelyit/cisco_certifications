1. What is EIGRP?

EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) is a Cisco proprietary advanced distance-vector routing protocol.

Sometimes called a hybrid protocol because it has characteristics of both distance-vector and link-state protocols.

Protocol type: Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)

Supports: IPv4, IPv6, and also MPLS VPNs (with DMVPN)

Administrative Distance (AD):

Internal EIGRP: 90

External EIGRP: 170

2. Key Features

DUAL (Diffusing Update Algorithm): Ensures loop-free paths and fast convergence.

Metric: Uses composite metric based on:

Bandwidth (most important)

Delay

Load (optional)

Reliability (optional)

MTU is not used in metric calculation.

Supports VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Mask)

Neighbor discovery using Hello packets (default 5s for LAN, 60s for WAN)

Reliable transport: Uses TCP-like Reliable Transport Protocol (RTP) for updates.

3. EIGRP Packet Types

Hello – Discovers and maintains neighbors.

Acknowledgment (ACK) – Confirms receipt of update messages.

Update – Sends routing information (partial updates only when there is a change).

Query – Sent when a route fails and a new route is needed.

Reply – Response to a Query.

Request – Requests routing info from a neighbor.

4. EIGRP Metric Calculation

Formula:

Metric
=
[
(
𝐾
1
⋅
Bandwidth
)
+
(
𝐾
2
⋅
Bandwidth
256
−
Load
)
+
𝐾

⋅Bandwidth
	​

)+K
3
	​

⋅Delay]⋅
K
4
	​

+Reliability
K
5
	​

	​


K-values are EIGRP constants (default K1=K3=1, K2=K4=K5=0)

Simplified: Metric = Bandwidth + Delay (default values)

Lower metric → better route

5. EIGRP Tables

EIGRP maintains three main tables:

Neighbor Table

Shows all directly connected EIGRP neighbors.

Verified by Hello packets.

Topology Table

Stores all learned routes from neighbors with feasible distance (FD) and reported distance (RD).

Routes must satisfy Feasible Successor criteria to be considered loop-free.

Routing Table

Contains the best routes to destinations.

Selected from the topology table using DUAL algorithm.

6. Feasible Successor Concept

A backup route stored in the topology table.

Conditions:

Reported Distance < Feasible Distance of the current successor.

Ensures loop-free backup paths.

7. EIGRP Timers

Hello interval: Default 5s LAN, 60s WAN

Hold time: Default 15s LAN, 180s WAN

If neighbor is not heard within this period → neighbor is declared down.

8. EIGRP Configuration (Basic)
Router(config)# router eigrp 100
Router(config-router)# network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255
Router(config-router)# no auto-summary


100 → EIGRP Autonomous System (AS) number

no auto-summary → disables automatic summarization

9. EIGRP Advanced Commands

Show neighbors: show ip eigrp neighbors

Show topology: show ip eigrp topology

Show routing table: show ip route eigrp

Passive-interface: Stop sending updates on certain interfaces

Redistribute static/other protocols: redistribute ospf metric 10000 100 255 1 1500

10. EIGRP Summarization

Supports manual summarization on any interface.

Automatic summarization occurs on classful network boundaries (can be disabled with no auto-summary).

11. EIGRP for IPv6

EIGRPv6 is configured separately from IPv4.

Router(config)# ipv6 router eigrp 100
Router(config-rtr)# no shutdown
Router(config)# interface g0/0
Router(config-if)# ipv6 eigrp 100

12. Key Advantages

Rapid convergence

Loop-free routing

Supports VLSM and CIDR

Efficient updates (partial and reliable)

Can scale well in large networks

13. Key Limitations

Cisco proprietary (unless using EIGRP for open standard)

Slightly more complex than RIP

Metric calculation may need careful tuning in mixed bandwidth environments

EIGRP Cheat Sheet
1. Basics
Feature	Value
Protocol Type	IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol)
Cisco Proprietary	Yes (unless using open standard EIGRP)
Metric Type	Composite (Bandwidth + Delay default)
Administrative Distance	Internal: 90, External: 170
Supports	IPv4, IPv6, VLSM, CIDR
2. Metric Calculation

Default Formula:

Metric
=
Bandwidth + Delay
Metric=Bandwidth + Delay

Bandwidth = 10^7 / minimum bandwidth (in Kbps)

Delay = sum of interface delays (in tens of μs)

Optional: Load, Reliability (requires K-values)

MTU is not used in metric

K-values default:

K1 = 1, K2 = 0, K3 = 1, K4 = 0, K5 = 0

3. Tables
Table	Purpose
Neighbor	Tracks directly connected EIGRP routers
Topology	All learned routes (FD & RD)
Routing	Best routes selected by DUAL algorithm

Feasible Successor: Loop-free backup route satisfying:

Reported Distance < Feasible Distance of Successor
Reported Distance < Feasible Distance of Successor
4. EIGRP Packet Types

Query	Ask neighbors for routes
Reply	Respond to Query
Request	Request routing info from neighbor
