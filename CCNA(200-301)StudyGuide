1. Networking Fundamentals

OSI Model (7 Layers)

Physical – cables, hubs, connectors

Data Link – MAC addresses, switches, VLANs

Network – IP addressing, routing

Transport – TCP/UDP, ports

Session – session management

Presentation – encryption, translation

Application – HTTP, DNS, SMTP
CP/IP Model

Application, Transport, Internet, Network Access

Map to OSI layers

IPv4 & IPv6

IPv4: 32-bit, 4 octets

IPv6: 128-bit, hex notation

Subnetting: calculate subnets, hosts, and broadcast addresses

Common Protocols

ICMP, ARP, DNS, DHCP, HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, SSH, Telnet

Cabling & Wireless

Ethernet cables (Cat5e, Cat6)

Fiber types (single-mode, multi-mode)

Wi-Fi standards (802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax)


2. Routing & Switching

Switching Concepts

MAC address table

VLANs: segmentation, VLAN trunking (802.1Q)

STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) – prevents loops

Routing Concepts

Static vs Dynamic Routing

Routing protocols: OSPF, EIGRP, RIP

Default gateway, routing tables

Router Configuration Basics

Router> enable
Router# configure terminal
Router(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/0
Router(config-if)# ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
Router(config-if)# no shutdown
Router(config-if)# exit
Router(config)# router ospf 1
Router(config-router)# network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 0

3. IP Services

NAT (Network Address Translation)

Static, Dynamic, PAT (Port Address Translation)

DHCP

Assigns IP addresses automatically

DNS

Resolves domain names to IPs

SNMP

Monitoring network devices

4. Security Fundamentals

Access Control

ACLs: Standard vs Extended

Device Hardening

Passwords, SSH instead of Telnet

Secure SNMP

Port Security

Limit MAC addresses per port on switches

VPN Basics

Remote secure access

5. Automation & Programmability

SDN Concepts

Controller-based networks

APIs

RESTful APIs to configure network devices

Configuration Management Tools

Ansible, Puppet, Chef (basics)

JSON/YAML

Data representation for automation

6. Troubleshooting & Network Management

Common Commands

ping <IP>           # Test connectivity
traceroute <IP>     # Trace path
show ip route       # View routing table
show interfaces     # Check interface status
show running-config # View current configuration

Layer-wise Troubleshooting

Physical: cables, link lights

Data link: MAC addresses, VLANs

Network: IP addresses, routing

7. Exam Preparation Tips

Labs

Use Packet Tracer or GNS3 for hands-on practice

Practice Exams

Measure your readiness

Flashcards

Memorize key protocols, port numbers, and subnetting tricks

Time Management

Don’t spend too long on one question

Understand, Don’t Memorize

Focus on why things work, not just commands
